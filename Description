A simple game of Tic Tac Toe with an AI. Made with C++ in VS2019. 

In this small project, the player chooses to either let the AI start the game or not. The AI in this game does not
rely solely on RNG (Random Number Generator) to select a spot on the board. It has a way to know when to block the
player's track or to win if the opportunity is there. 

Originally, this project was an assignment I had to do when I took Artificial Intelligence back in school learning
about the Min Max Algorithm. Back then, the code looked intimidating to look at, so I was inspired to write up a 
cleaner looking code when I recreated this project.
